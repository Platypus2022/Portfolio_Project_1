                <h3>The Mammalian Diving Reaction</h3>
                <br>
                <p>How long can you hold your breath out of water? </p>
                <p>You probably never tried. Why should you - there's plenty of air around to breathe.</p>
                <p>You could easily hold your breath for 30 seconds, but when you feel that 'urge to breathe' you might think, "Time's up, ' must be no oxygen left."</p>
                <p>In fact, you'll likely have more that 90% in still in your blood and this can go a long way further. The 'urge to breath' is a physiological response to reduce the level of CO2 in your lungs and the trick is to delay this response.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As soon as your face is submerged in water, the Mammalian Diving Reaction is activated, which effectively slows down this physiological response and allows you to spend longer under water with one breath-hold.</p>
                <p>That's already a start free of charge. The next thing is to improve your breathing and fill those inner cavities with as much air as possible: this is where our yoga and mindfulness techniques will help.</p>

                <h3>Breathing Techniques</h3>
                <br>
                <p>No, we are not going to make you stand on your head in a Sirsasana. If you can, then respect! We steal a few interesting techniques from Yoga and mindfulness to help you concentrate on your breathing techniques.</p>
                <p>We help you improve your 'belly-breathing' as well as your lung capacity and teach you great exercises that will not just improve your dive - when practiced they will make you calm and relaxed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Equalising techniques, where air is pumped from the mouth to the inner ear, keep you at the same pressure as the surrounding water and are cricial when free-diving.</p>
                <p>Very few people can do this naturally, so yes, we've all been through the practice and have plenty of helpful hints for you to get the hang of it very quickly.</p>
